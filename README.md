# WiDS_Datathon_ClimateChange

WiDS Datathon 2022 - https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2022/overview

This challenge aims at analyzing differences in building energy efficiency, creating models to predict building energy consumption. We use a dataset consisting of variables that describe building characteristics and climate and weather variables for the regions in which the buildings are located. The WiDS Datathon dataset was created in collaboration with Climate Change AI (CCAI) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab).

Our team secured 16th position on the final leaderboard with a final score of 19.425 (https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2022/leaderboard)
